# Steps taken to avoid common attacks

* Have followed Solidity coding standards.
* Used audited libraries like Ownable and Pausable from OpenZeppelin.
* Have avoided complex structures.
* Have added require statements to each functions to validate data before proceding.
* Have limited the accessibility by making things private so they can only be accessed from within the contract.
* Unit testing to unsure code is functioning as expected.
